    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, we implement a cloth simulator and corresponding shaders. In part 1, we represent our cloth
      with a 2D grid of point masses and springs, which we encode in row-major order for consistency. To simulate movement
      of the cloth in part 2, we compute the total force acting on each point mass and use verlet integration to update the 
      new positions. If the new position is too unreasonable (ie. the spring's length between 2 masses is 1.1x greater
      than its rest length), we apply a correction on the point mass to enforce constraints. In part 3, implement code to 
      handle the cloth's collisions with other objects, including a sphere and a plane. We handle self-collisions between the
      cloth and itself in part 4 by implementing spatial hashing that speeds up naive computations. Lastly in part 5, 
      we implement vertex and fragment shaders to expand the capabilities of our simulation.

    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The effects of changing the ks constant are more visible when the cloth is colored as opposed
      when it's wired. 
      At a low ks (ie. 200) and keeping all other constants as default, the cloth seems stretchier and more 
      delicate. As the cloth falls, we can see many folds form at the top of the pinned corners, 
      and the folds remain after the cloth reaches its equilibrium state. The lower, unpinned corners
      of the cloth also pan outwards from the gravity.
      At a high ks (ie. 10000) and keeping all other constants as default, the cloth seems 
      much stiffer. As it falls, only one or two folds form at the top near the pinned corners.
      This cloth also reaches equilibrium faster than the low ks cloth, and its unpinned corners don't sag
      from gravity.

    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Low density achieves a similar effect to high ks, while high density achieves a similar effect to low ks. 
      At a low density (ie 5) with other constants kept as default values, the cloth appears stiff and thick. As it falls, only one or two folds form at the top near the pinned corners.
      This cloth also reaches equilibrium relatively quickly, and its unpinned corners don't sag
      from gravity. 
      At a higher density (ie 1000) with other constants kept as default values, the cloth appears more fragile and succeptible to gravity. 
      As the cloth falls, we can see many folds form at the top of the pinned corners, 
      and the folds remain after the it reaches equilibrium. The lower, unpinned corners
      of the cloth also pan outwards.

    <p>
      At lower damping values, the cloth appears bouncy, as it takes a while for it to reach equilibrium. We often see the unpinned corners 
      curving in towards the middle of the cloth as it swings. 
      At higher damping values, the cloth falls immediately from start to equilibrium in a swooping motion, and the bottom, unpinned corners
      barely sway back and forth. 
      The equilibrium states do not seem affected by damping values, only the time it takes the cloth to reach equilibrium.

      The top left image shows the cloth at equilibrium using the default parameters, and the top right image shows the default cloth 
      falling towards equilibrium. 
      The middle left shows an image of the cloth simulated using lower ks values of 200, and the bottom left shows an image 
      of the cloth simulated with a high density of 1000. In both these cases, we can see that the cloth drapes significantly more
      than default as if the cloth is more succeptible to gravity, and we can also see the unpinned corners drape to the sides. 
      While damping doesn't affect equilibrium much, it does affect the cloth as it reaches equilibrium. The bottom right image 
      was generated with low damping and shows the cloth bending and bouncing significantly as it reaches equilibrium.

      <small>Describe the differences in the results.</small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      With a low spring constant (i.e. ks of 500), the top of the cloth sags tightly around the ball.
      We see a bit more separation with a higher spring constant (ks of 5000), where parts of the cloth
      are sticking out away from the sphere. At a spring constant ks of 50000, most of the cloth is barely
      touching the sphere (looks like it is trying to repel the cloth away) and does not sag. Having a spring constant
      that is too small or too large makes the cloth physics look unrealistic (too much/too little sagging) - as such,
      a constant near the middle (i.e. 5000) looks the most realistic.

      A lower density gives the cloth a thicker, more sturdy appearance; the number of folds that appear
      when the cloth is falling is less than default, and the folds that form when the cloth falls on top of
      itself are larger. 
      A higher density gives the cloth a thin, delicate, and sheer appearance. There are significantly more folds 
      as the cloth falls compared to default or the lower-density cloth. There are many more folds when the cloth falls 
      on top of itself, and we can also see "micro-folds" form in the flatter parts of the cloth.

      A high ks has a similar effect to low density, and a low ks has a similar effect to high density. 
      At a lower ks, the cloth appears softer and more fragile as more folds form when it falls. Like the 
      high density cloth, the folds are smaller and more collapsed, and we can see "micro folds" along the 
      flatter parts of the cloth. 
      At a higher ks, the cloth appears thicker and more rigid. Like the low density cloth, the folds are larger, 
      taller, and more pronounced. While some micro folds are visible as the cloth falls, they mostly dissapear 
      when the cloth reaches equilibrium.

    <blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to 
    create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Executing raytrace computation on CPUs is incredibly slow and often has unreasonably slow lag for interactive
      applications. Shader programs help speed up this computation through parallelism on GPUs. There are two types
      of shaders that make up the program: vertex shaders and fragment shaders. Vertex shaders work by applying transformations
      to vertices and modifying their positions and normal vectors to transform from one coordinate plane to another. 
      Fragment shaders process fragments produced from the rasterization process and colors the pixel. In a shader 
      program, the interpolated output of a vertex shader is fed into the fragment shader to produce different lighting and material
      effects.

    Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. 
    Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only 
    outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using 
    the entire Blinn-Phong model.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The Blinn-Phong shading model combines ambient, diffuse, and specular light to simulate realistic lighting 
      effects. Ambient light does not depend on view direction and is a constant value that adds color to the object. 
      Diffuse light is light scattered uniformly in all directions. While it is independent of the view direction, 
      as the angle between the light source and the surface increases, the intensity decreases. Specular reflection 
      depends on view direction and reflects the incoming light in one direction, producing a glossy look. Added together, 
      these 3 types of light combine to form a realistic rendering of light on an object.

    <p>
      These images were rendered using the 3rd texture (brick wall). In order to generate the bump mappings, we manipulated the normal vectors of our object 
      to be scaled based on a user-inputted height scaling factor (`u_height_scaling`) and normal scaling factor (`u_normal_scaling`). As such, this would alter
      our normal vectors to render the specified texture (via a height map) by manipulating the normal vector. Displacement mapping generates textures in a similar factor; however,
      displacement mapping also alters the position of vertices to be consistent with the texture height map, causing a bit more jaggedness/volume in our rendered image.<br><br>

      In the rendered spheres, using a less coarse mesh (i.e. `-o 16 -a 16`) causes the rendered image to appear smoother, though the added smoothing may cause the sphere to 
      be a bit deformed (i.e. edges are not perfectly round). Using a coarser mesh (i.e. `-o 128 -a 128`) causes the rendered image/texture to appear rougher, but the resulting 
      image resembles the original sphere a lot better (i.e. not as smooth, but more sphere-like).
